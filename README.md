# 100 Projects Challenge

This repository aims to expand my teorethical and practical knowledge of programming languages. Basic language used across all projects is Python but along with progress other will be included as well (e.g Javascript).

The repository is created so that each folder corresponds to the project number and each subfolder correspond to the language in which they were written.

## Dependencies

As it is a challenge, only built-in Python standard library will be used.
For Graphical User Interface will be using Tkinter.

If you would like to test or contribute to one of the projects:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/MrDominikku/100_projects_challenge
```

# Wish me luck!

# 1. Name Generator

Generator iterate through each category in config.py file and add them to combobox. Using simple random function generator pick name/surname, concatenate and adds it to listbox view. Generated list can be copied to text editor. Config can be easly extended by new categories without changing main code.
